<h1>IS BITCOIN A GOOD INVESTMENT - THE ANSWER IS, YES!</h1>


<p>A collective insanity has sprouted around Bitcoin over the last decade. It's hard to predict whether this cryptocurrency will become the global reserve currency or a store of value as widely accepted as gold, it has posed to have limitless potentials for the future. The thrill of riches or ruin leaves some investors wary, but informed others have have seen the need to chase the opportunity as provided by Experttrades LLC for massive profits from investing in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is certainly a revolutionary technology, and it's much less risky in 2023 than it was in 2012.</p>

<p>After becoming legal tender in Canada, Germany, Slovenia, Malta, The Netherlands, Singapore, Estonia, El Salvador among others in 2021, other countries may look to copy this move to attract innovation and development into the future, while others might ban it entirely in an attempt to save their fiat currency or clear the way for a central bank digital currency, they will only find themselves behind in technology and digital development.</p>


<p>Bitcoin is just one of the internet digital currency innovations and it’s already making massive waves across the globe. Despite the doom and gloom of the 2022 bear market, Bitcoin has solidified its spot in the global geopolitical climate, and the 2020s may be the year of massive adoption. This has led investors to wonder if Bitcoin is a good investment. The answer to this question varies, depending on who is asking it and will always lead to this, “the best time to buy bitcoin is 5 years and the bad time to buy bitcoin is later, buy bitcoin NOW and wait.” Experttrades LLC is here to help you do that, providing insurance policies to cover for both capital and capital gains.</p>


<p>Bitcoin is a good investment as it fits your risk tolerance and your general market outlook. The history of the cryptocurrency market is actually rather predictable on longer time horizons. Bitcoin and Ethereum have traded in relatively regular cycles and both have recovered from every major crash (not including the most recent, yet) and subsequently reached new all-time highs either way Experttrades LLC has studied and technically analyzed the market thereby adopting the use of automated trading bots and sophisticated softwares like the MT4 and MT5 trading strategies to generate a steady positive progress margin on every trade estimated to +89% as of the last time a survey was conducted on January 21 2023. Simply, it has been proven that Experttrades LLC can generate a stable return from the Crypto(Bitcoin) market whichever way the market moves (upwards/downwards) for this reason it has been ranked the Number 1 Private Brokerage Company by the Blockchain Council.</p>


<h3>The History Of Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Since its inception, Bitcoin was the 1st digital asset to beget the current ecosystem of cryptos. The release of the whitepaper describing the tech just after the 2008 financial crisis was a quiet start to the cryptocurrency revolution. It’s proven that paper money is no so reliable as it is controlled by the Government and the Elite. Bitcoin will do to banks same thing emails did to the postal office. For quite a while, it grew an underground following of investors who saw its future as a possible replacement to the physical monetary system. Now Bitcoin has become a household name as institutions and governments develop ways to serve their customers growing demand for exposure.</p>


<p>Similar to how the internet was once a speculative investment, Bitcoin has received similar criticism. In reality, Bitcoin‘s current adoption rate outpaces that of the internet's in 1998, and millions of people now own Bitcoin and millions more learn about it everyday (BE INFORMED TODAY!) And the spread at which its adoption is spreading seems to only be increasing daily.</p>


<p>In 2021, El Salvador became the 1st country in the world to make Bitcoin a legal tender, followed by Canada, Germany, Slovenia, Malta, Estonia, Paraguay and other small countries look to follow suit. El Salvador is also the first and only country to have Bitcoin in its treasury. As of late 2022, El Salvador has roughly 3,400 Bitcoin. President Nayib Bukele has not been shy about announcing his purchases on Twitter.</p>



<h3>Is Bitcoin A Good Investment Despite The Risk?</h3>
<p>Similar to any speculative investment, buying Bitcoin obviously carries significant risk, but this is only in the case that coin is left in an exchange like coinbase, crypto.com, robinhood, among others and this is why these exchanges have partnered with us to handle individual and multiple trading accounts on behalf of their clients. As the traditional finance world realizes Bitcoin's potential for disruption, they must choose either to adopt cryptocurrencies or face irrelevance.</p>


<p>We at Experttrades LLC strongly advice any informed traditional investor to adopt change and technology with bitcoin. Its volatility risk is one of the major factors determining whether Bitcoin is a good investment but it isn't necessarily good or bad as we already have automated trading bots and sophisticated softwares like the MT4 and MT5 trading strategies to generate a guaranteed return margin. The personal decision to invest in Bitcoin comes down to your appetite for tax-free money, freedom, control and your perspective on the future of humanity. For example, Russia has stated they are looking into cryptocurrencies to lower their dependence on the US dollar. Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the US dollar in a massive way, and it is simply too big to be ignored at this point. If this disruption is successful, Bitcoin will be more than a fantastic investment!</p>



<p>The main reason a traditional investor may want exposure to Bitcoin is to hedge against inflation, make tax-free income (avoiding tax on capital gains), have control over there money and potentially the collapse of the fiat-based economy. Bitcoin's volatility is a concern to many investors, however volatility is expected to decrease forever as institutions and governments enter the market with long-term interest. Not only that, Volatility has been the foundation on which profits is generated by out esteemed professional traders. Our clients are in perfect hands.

<h3>Advantages Of Bitcoin Investments</h3>
<p>The overwhelming performance of Bitcoin — as a currency and investment — has attracted traditional and institutional investors alike. They are all asking: Is Bitcoin a good investment? To be fair, it offers you far more several advantages over traditional investments.</p>
<p>Liquidity. Bitcoin is arguably 1 of the most liquid investment assets due to the worldwide establishment of trading platforms, exchanges and online brokerages. You can easily trade Bitcoin for cash or assets like gold instantly with incredibly low fees. The high liquidity associated with Bitcoin makes it a potentially great investment vessel if you’re looking for short-term massive profit. Digital currencies may also be a long-term investment due to their high market demand. Lower inflation risk. Unlike world currencies — which are regulated by their governments — Bitcoin is nearly immune to hyperinflation. It still undergoes inflation but at a predictable rate that is halved every 4 years after which comes a bullish season. The blockchain system is infinite and there’s little need to worry about your cryptos losing their value.</p>
<p>New opportunities. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is relatively young — new coins are becoming mainstream on a daily basis. This newness brings unpredictable swings in price and volatility, which may create opportunities for massive gains. Minimalistic trading. Stock trading can be a tedious process covered in red tape and can only be done during specific market hours. You must also go through a broker to trade a company’s shares. But Bitcoin trading is minimalistic: simply buy or sell Bitcoin from exchanges whenever you want, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Bitcoin transactions are also instant — unlike the settlement of stock trading orders, which could take days or weeks. Bitcoin is by far a much more risk-free lucrative investment.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages Of Bitcoin Investments</h3>
<p>Bitcoin may be the future of monetary exchange, but it is equally important that you are aware of the concerns surrounding cryptocurrency investing. Listed below are the only things that could make Bitcoin a bad investment. Balancing the pros and cons is often the most important thing an investor can do. Note: How this is handled, view …”link for Insurance Policy <a href="insurance-policy.html">here</a>”</p>
<p>Volatility. The price of Bitcoin is always rippling back and forth. If you happened to buy Bitcoin on December 17, 2017, the price was $20,000. Weeks later, you couldn’t sell your investment for more than $7,051. While you'd be doing great now, holding for years at a time is not a viable option for all investors. Mind the word, “HOLDING” this is why it’s always advised to “INVEST” with a trading brokerage company just like Experttrades LLC. Threat of hacking. While Bitcoin's blockchain has never been hacked, individuals can still get hacked if they give out sensitive information, such as their private keys. Also, it's not uncommon for lesser-known exchanges to be hacked. For best security, use a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano X that stores your digital assets off the internet on an external device.</p>
